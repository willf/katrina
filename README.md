Post Katrina New Orleans
========================

An aerial photo of New Orleans, post Katrina, with a zoomable interface (back
when this sort of thing was new).

To install, just copy to some directory. The tiles directory contains all the
pieces.

I was working on clickable interfaces for a NASA autonomous helicopter at the time,
and the code and images naturally fell together.
